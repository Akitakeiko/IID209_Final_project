# IID209_Final_project
 This is a repository contains all data packets and codes for final project from the course IID 209: Microbial Communities and the Human Microbiome (Spring 2024).

The final project explores how different infant formulas influence the development of the gut microbiome in infants during the critical early life stages, and it focuses on the supplementation of bovine Milk Fat Globule Membrane (MFGM) in infant formulas, aiming to replicate the benefits of natural breastfeeding. It addresses the gap in existing research by examining specific developmental milestones at 4 and 12 months, periods key for the introduction of solid foods and other dietary transitions.

The project employs a robust bioinformatics pipeline using the QIIME2 platform to analyze 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data, covering processes from sequence importation and denoising to advanced statistical analyses, including alpha and beta diversity assessments. It highlights significant findings, such as the experimental formula potentially supporting a microbial diversity closer to that of breastfed infants, especially at earlier stages of development. The research provides valuable insights into optimizing infant formula compositions to better emulate the protective and developmental advantages of breastfeeding, contributing to discussions on early-life nutritional strategies and their long-term health impacts.
